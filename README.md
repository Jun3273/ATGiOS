## ATGiOS

Automated Tour Guide (ATG) is a mobile application used to help new students and employees that are fully or partially blind to create a mental map of predetermined routes on campus.
The routes are recorded using the RouteCreator, a web application based on Google map used to select and store locations and record audible descriptions of those locations.

This project was delivered to Purdue DRC in Fall 2019.
